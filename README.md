Credit Risk Analysis using Machine Learning

**Description**

This project aims to build predictive models for credit risk assessment using a dataset of borrower attributes and loan features. The analysis utilizes machine learning techniques to predict loan defaults, enabling financial institutions to make informed decisions. The dataset consists of 32,581 entries, including demographic information (e.g., age, income) and loan details (e.g., loan amount, interest rate). The project is designed to improve the accuracy of credit risk models, thereby contributing to better lending decisions.

The study involves a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) and applies different models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, to determine the best-performing model for credit risk prediction.

**Features**

Data Cleaning and Preparation: Imputed missing values and removed outliers to ensure data quality.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to uncover important patterns and relationships among borrower attributes and loan features.

Machine Learning Models: Built and evaluated Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models to assess their ability to predict loan defaults.

Model Evaluation: Evaluated the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Technologies Used**

Python programming language.

Pandas and NumPy for data cleaning and manipulation.

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.

Scikit-learn for machine learning model development.

**Results**

Logistic Regression: Achieved an accuracy of 86.63% with a moderate performance in predicting loan defaults.

Decision Tree: Improved performance compared to Logistic Regression with an accuracy of 89.47%, demonstrating balanced precision and recall.

Random Forest: Outperformed other models with an accuracy of 93%, showing strong prediction capabilities for both default and non-default loans.

**Future Improvements**

Advanced Feature Engineering: Add more features or interactions between features to improve model performance.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Perform hyperparameter optimization to further enhance the accuracy of the models.

Deep Learning Models: Consider using neural networks for more complex feature interactions and improved accuracy.
